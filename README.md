## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

I just finished this front-end coding challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). It was a fun project that helped me improve my HTML and CSS skills by building a simple, responsive QR code component.

Check out my solution and feel free to explore the code in this repo!

## The Challenge

The task was to build out a QR code component and get it to look as close to the design as possible. The challenge included both mobile (375px) and desktop (1440px) layouts to ensure responsiveness.

Hereâ€™s how I approached it:

1. Structured the content using **HTML**.
2. Styled and ensured responsiveness with **CSS** and **media queries**.
3. Applied best practices for layout and responsiveness.

## Tools Used

- HTML
- CSS
- Media queries for responsive design
